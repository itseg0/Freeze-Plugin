Frozen

Basically, this is my new plugin which allows players to (un)freeze players, view who's frozen and autoban players who leave the server while banned. Almost all messages are customisable from the settings.yml

Commands

/freeze {Player} {Reason} - Freezes a player

/unfreeze {Player} - Unfreezes a player

/autoban {Toggle} - Sets whether you should ban a player who leaves while frozen

/frozen - See all players who are frozen


Perms

freeze.autoban
freeze.freezeall
freeze.freeze
freeze.unfreeze
freeze.frozen


Thanks and enjoy my plugin!
